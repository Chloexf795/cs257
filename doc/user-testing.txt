User Testing Observations:

Things the testers found easy:
1. Using dropdown filters to choose crime types and areas.
2. Understanding the layout and visual structure of the page.

Things the testers had trouble with:
1. Victim demographics (age and gender) were not clearly labeled or explained; users weren’t sure what the charts were showing.
2. When a filter selection resulted in no available data, the trend graph did not indicate that explicitly, which caused confusion.
3. Users felt overwhelmed by the number of crime types and areas in the dropdown menus; it was hard to know where to start.
4. Several users ran into situations where, after applying filters, no data was shown. They were unsure whether this was an error or due to limited dataset availability.

Other positive comments or observations:
1. Testers found the overall visual design clear and understandable. 

Other suggestions for improvement:
1. Adding a message to the graph area when no data is available. (e.g. "No data found for the selected filter.")
2. Group or prioritize crime types and areas in the filter to reduce overwhelm—possibly use most frequent ones at the top or allow for search.
3. Switching filters to tags, where users can select multiple features at the same time. 
4. Adding some data.
